# softbank-robotics-demo
Demo scripts for NAOqi,qi and qiBullet software for Softbank Robots

This repo recollects demos from NAOqi/qi official documentation, [qiBullet](https://github.com/softbankrobotics-research/qibullet) and made up.
The demos have been reformatted for better readability and updated to be Python 2/Python 3 compliant in the case of qiBullet codes.

The codes have been divided in directories, depending on the software. Every directory contains a README with the requirements, brief description of each demo and general instructions on how to run them.
